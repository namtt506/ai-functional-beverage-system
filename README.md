# AI Functional Beverage Development Expert System

## Project Overview
An AI-powered functional beverage development expert system using deep learning technology. The system autonomously implements end-to-end functional beverage R&D from nutritional supplement selection to reprocessing workflow design.

## Key Features
- Intelligent consumer demand analysis and nutritional ingredient matching
- Multi-nutritional supplement fusion and synergy analysis
- Formulation optimization and production process generation
- Market potential evaluation and commercial value analysis
- Continuous learning and optimization capabilities

## Technical Architecture
- **Main Architecture**: Deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous decision-making system
- **Core Components**: Deep Q-Network (DQN), Synergy Analysis Engine, Formulation Optimization Module
- **Supporting Architecture**: Transformer architecture for ingredient relationship modeling
- **Data Support**: 28 branded nutritional supplements, 10 consumer groups, 47 health goals
